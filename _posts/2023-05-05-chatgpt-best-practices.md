When prompting ChatGPT to write code, it's essential to provide a clear and concise description of what you need. Here are a few tips and templates to help you get the desired results:

1. Specify the language or library: Clearly mention the programming language, library, or framework you want the code to be written in.

Template:
```
Write a [language/library] code to [task description].
```
Example:
```
Write a Python code to reverse a string.
```

2. Provide detailed requirements: Be specific about the inputs, outputs, and any constraints or requirements the code must fulfill.

Template:
```
Write a [language/library] function that takes [input description] and returns [output description] with the following constraints: [constraint list].
```
Example:
```
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of even numbers with the following constraints: the function should not use built-in functions like sum().
```

3. Include examples: Provide examples of inputs and expected outputs to help clarify your requirements.

Template:
```
Write a [language/library] function to [task description]. Here's an example of the input and expected output:

Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]
```
Example:
```
Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. Here's an example of the input and expected output:

Input: 5
Output: 120
```

4. Ask for explanations or comments: If you want ChatGPT to explain the code or provide comments, mention this explicitly in your prompt.

Template:
```
Write a [language/library] code to [task description] and explain how it works or provide comments to describe each step.
```
Example:
```
Write a Python code to find the longest common prefix of a list of strings and provide comments to describe each step.
```

5. Request code snippets for existing code: If you need help with a specific part of your existing code, provide a clear description of the problem and the relevant code snippet.

Template:
```
I have the following [language/library] code:

[Your code snippet]

I need help with [problem description].
```
Example:
```
I have the following Python code:

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

I need help with converting this function to accept a list of names and return a list of greetings.
```

Remember that the more specific and detailed your prompt is, the more accurate and helpful the generated code will be.

Last year, hedge fund [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) opened a position for 'Software Engineer: Complex Events Engineering'. They explained that Complex Events Engineering is looking for a software engineer to help build a world-class platform for automated research and large-scale data analysis. Our team’s mission is to collect, organize, and monetize complex and unstructured data, from financial news and analyst reports to television and social media. They also wrote that the responsibilities for this role include 'Developing scalable systems for automated idea generation and evaluation.'

Automated idea generation and evaluation systems, as mentioned in the job posting by [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), refer to technology platforms designed to autonomously generate and assess ideas or hypotheses, primarily to aid in decision-making, financial analysis, or research activities. Here’s a deeper understanding of its components and functions:

1. **Automated Idea Generation**:
   - This involves the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence to autonomously generate new ideas or hypotheses based on available data. For instance, in the context of Two Sigma's financial focus, this might involve identifying new investment strategies or trading opportunities.
   - The system might utilize a variety of data sources such as financial news, analyst reports, and social media to generate insights or ideas. 
   - Advanced data analytics, machine learning, natural language processing, and other AI techniques would likely be employed to sift through large amounts of structured and unstructured data to uncover potential patterns or actionable insights.

2. **Automated Evaluation**:
   - After generating ideas, the system then needs to evaluate the potential viability, risks, and rewards associated with each idea.
   - Evaluation could be done through back-testing against historical data, simulating different market conditions, or using other statistical and financial analysis methods to assess the potential impact and performance of the ideas generated.
   - The goal is to provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the merit of different ideas, which can then inform decision-making within the hedge fund.

3. **Integration into a Larger System**:
   - In the context provided, these automated systems are part of a broader platform aimed at facilitating automated research and large-scale data analysis. 
   - The generated ideas and their evaluations would likely feed into other systems or processes within the hedge fund, aiding in investment decisions, risk management, and other core operations.

4. **Scalability**:
   - The mention of developing "scalable systems" indicates a focus on building platforms capable of handling growing amounts of data and computational demands, ensuring that the system remains effective as the scope of data and analysis requirements increase.

5. **Cross-Disciplinary Effort**:
   - The multifaceted nature of this role suggests that it would likely require a combination of skills in software engineering, data science, finance, and possibly domain-specific knowledge to effectively design, implement, and optimize such automated idea generation and evaluation systems.

This role at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) seems to align with a broader trend within finance and other data-driven industries toward leveraging advanced computational techniques and AI to automate and augment various aspects of the research and decision-making process.
